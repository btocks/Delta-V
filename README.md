# Delta-V
As a part of my Python learning, I wanted to visually represent a concept discussed during a meeting within my team at work.

The speaker spoke to us about Tsiolkovsky's Rocket Equation. More specifically, to propel ourselves forward, we need to expel some of our mass. He was using this as a metaphor to let go of the failures of our past so that we can launch ourselves towards the success of the future.

I already had a Python presentation planned to showcase my current learnings with the team, none of whom have Python experience but have coded in other programming languages. I saw this as a perfect opportunity to create a project I had not seen displayed as a "beginner Python project".

Please let me know if you have any suggestions on how to make this code cleaner or more concise!

(Please Note: I have so many commented lines of code as I chose to do a code walkthrough during the presentation)
